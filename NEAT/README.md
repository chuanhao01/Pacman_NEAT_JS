# FLAPPY_BIRD_NEAT_JS
Hello there, this was a mini side project I did as I was interested in the field of reinforcement learning as well as genetic algorithms.  

After doing the [XVis Tool Project](https://github.com/chuanhao01/XVis_Tool) during my internship at DSTA, this paper on gentic algorithms, particularly neuro evolution, which allowed a Neural Network to evolve and grow seemed pretty cool.  
The paper was called Evolving Neural Networks through Augmenting Topologies or NEAT for short.  

Too many sleepless nights and pain was put into this.  

Huge thanks to David([@David-The-Programmer](https://github.com/David-The-Programmer)) for helping me to code the flappy bird game as well as integrating NEAT into the game.

I still don't know why I did this, but here is my native Javascript implementation of the paper.

Working version is in the neat_v6 folder.

A link to see it working on learning to play flappy bird can be seen [here](https://chuanhao01.github.io/Javascript_NEAT/).  


Note, DO NOT LEAVE IT RUNNING FOREVER. My memory allocation and management is still shit so your google chrome might crash.  

Also if it lags and is still not able to play flappy bird, just refresh the browser :D.

Why did I do this to myself.
